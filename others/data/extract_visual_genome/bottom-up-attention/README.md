# bottom-up-attention

This code implements a bottom-up attention model, based on multi-gpu training of Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101, using object and attribute annotations from [Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/).

The pretrained model generates output features corresponding to salient image regions. These bottom-up attention features can typically be used as a drop-in replacement for CNN features in attention-based image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) models. This approach was used to achieve state-of-the-art image captioning performance on [MSCOCO](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results) (**CIDEr 117.9**, **BLEU_4 36.9**) and to win the [2017 VQA Challenge](http://www.visualqa.org/workshop.html) (**70.3%** overall accuracy), as described in:
- [Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998), and 
- [Tips and Tricks for Visual Question Answering: Learnings from the 2017 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02711). 

Some example object and attribute predictions for salient image regions are illustrated below.

Note: This repo only includes code for training the bottom-up attention / Faster R-CNN model (section 3.1 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998)). The actual captioning model (section 3.2) is available in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Up-Down-Captioner).

### Pretrained features

For ease-of-use, we make pretrained features available for the entire [MSCOCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download). It is not necessary to clone or build this repo to use features downloaded from the links below. Features are stored in tsv (tab-separated-values) format that can be read with `tools/read_tsv.py`.

If the above links are too slow, the features can be downloaded from Google Cloud Storage at own cost using the Requester Pays feature. Use the following gsutil commands where [PROJECT_ID] is your Cloud Storage project id that should be billed (further documentation can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-requester-pays)):

10 to 100 features per image (adaptive):
```
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/trainval.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2014 Train/Val Image Features (120K / 23GB)
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/test2014.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2014 Testing Image Features (40K / 7.3GB)
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/test2015.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2015 Testing Image Features (80K / 15GB)
```

36 features per image (fixed):
```
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/trainval_36.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2014 Train/Val Image Features (120K / 25GB)
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/test2014_36.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2014 Testing Image Features (40K / 9GB)
gsutil -u [PROJECT_ID] cp gs://bottom-up-attention/test2015_36.zip [OBJECT_DESTINATION] # 2015 Testing Image Features (80K / 17GB)
```

Both sets of features can be recreated by using `tools/genenerate_tsv.py` with the appropriate pretrained model and with MIN_BOXES/MAX_BOXES set to either 10/100 or 36/36 respectively - refer [Demo](#demo).

4. [Demo](#demo)
5. [Training](#training)
6. [Testing](#testing)

### Requirements: software

0. **`Important`** Please use the version of caffe contained within this repository.

1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers and NCCL!

  ```make
  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have these lines uncommented
  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
  USE_NCCL := 1
  # Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN
  USE_CUDNN := 1
  ```
2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`
3. Nvidia's NCCL library which is used for multi-GPU training https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl

### Requirements: hardware

Any NVIDIA GPU with 12GB or larger memory is OK for training Faster R-CNN ResNet-101.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention/
  ```

3. Build the Cython modules
    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/lib
    make
    ```

4. Build Caffe and pycaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/caffe
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed
    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:
    make -j8 && make pycaffe
   ```

### Demo

1.  Download [pretrained model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tr24q7h0zm2wnjv/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final.caffemodel?dl=1), and put it under `data\faster_rcnn_models`.
   
2.  Run `tools/demo.ipynb` to show object and attribute detections on demo images.

3.  Run `tools/genenerate_tsv.py` to extract bounding box features to a tab-separated-values (tsv) file. This will require modifying the `load_image_ids` function to suit your data locations. To recreate the pretrained feature files with 10 to 100 features per image, set MIN_BOXES=10 and MAX_BOXES=100. To recreate the pretrained feature files with 36 features per image, set MIN_BOXES=36 and MAX_BOXES=36 use this [alternative pretrained model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bacig173qnxddvz/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final_iter_320000.caffemodel?dl=1) instead. The alternative pretrained model was trained for fewer iterations but performance is similar.
  

### Training

1. Download the Visual Genome dataset. Extract all the json files, as well as the image directories `VG_100K` and `VG_100K_2` into one folder `$VGdata`.

2. Create symlinks for the Visual Genome dataset

    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/data
    ln -s $VGdata vg
    ``` 

3. Generate xml files for each image in the pascal voc format (this will take some time). This script will extract the top 2500/1000/500 objects/attributes/relations and also does basic cleanup of the visual genome data. Note however, that our training code actually only uses a subset of the annotations in the xml files, i.e., only 1600 object classes and 400 attribute classes, based on the hand-filtered vocabs found in `data/genome/1600-400-20`. The relevant part of the codebase is `lib/datasets/vg.py`. Relation labels can be included in the data layers but are currently not used.

    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT
    ./data/genome/setup_vg.py
    ``` 

4.  Please download the ImageNet-pre-trained ResNet-100 model manually, and put it into `$REPO_ROOT/data/imagenet_models`

5.  You can train your own model using `./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end_multi_gpu_resnet_final.sh` (see instructions in file). The train (95k) / val (5k) / test (5k) splits are in `data/genome/{split}.txt` and have been determined using `data/genome/create_splits.py`. To avoid val / test set contamination when pre-training for MSCOCO tasks, for images in both datasets these splits match the 'Karpathy' COCO splits. 
  

    Trained Faster-RCNN snapshots are saved under:

    ```
    output/faster_rcnn_resnet/vg/
    ```

    Logging outputs are saved under:

    ```
    experiments/logs/
    ```

6.  Run `tools/review_training.ipynb` to visualize the training data and predictions.

### Testing 

1.  The model will be tested on the validation set at the end of training, or models can be tested directly using `tools/test_net.py`, e.g.:

    ```
    ./tools/test_net.py --gpu 0 --imdb vg_1600-400-20_val --def models/vg/ResNet-101/faster_rcnn_end2end_final/test.prototxt --cfg experiments/cfgs/faster_rcnn_end2end_resnet.yml --net data/faster_rcnn_models/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final.caffemodel > experiments/logs/eval.log 2<&1
    ```

    Mean AP is reported separately for object prediction and attibute prediction (given ground-truth object detections). Test outputs are saved under:

    ```
    output/faster_rcnn_resnet/vg_1600-400-20_val/<network snapshot name>/
    ```

#### Expected detection results for the pretrained model

|                   | objects mAP@0.5     | objects weighted mAP@0.5 | attributes mAP@0.5    | attributes weighted mAP@0.5 |
|-------------------|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|Faster R-CNN, ResNet-101 | 10.2%  | 15.1% | 7.8%  | 27.8% |


Note that mAP is relatively low because many classes overlap (e.g. person / man / guy), some classes can't be precisely located (e.g. street, field) and separate classes exist for singular and plural objects (e.g. person / people). We focus on performance in downstream tasks (e.g. image captioning, VQA) rather than detection performance.
